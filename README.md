# Programming-Club--Practice-for-Interviews

This repository is aimed towards helping students with their interview preparations. Everyday, the Programming club will be sending a problem, which would be chosen from the ones asked by the companies in their interview process. Editorial for the problem will be provided here at a later date.


The format of the problem is as follows:
A Problem Statement will be presented which will ask the general problem. Try to do it (even in brute-force)
Some Follow-up problems will then be given which will test more advanced coding skills. Generally, this might be asked in companies starting with 7+ lpa profiles.

So, do try the problem and freshen up your coding skills. It'll hardly take 30 min in a day. You don't need to send your solutions. You can verify them using the editorials. I advise everyone to at least solve brute force implementation. All the best for your preparations.
